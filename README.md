## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- TypeScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) - JS build tool
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - For styles


### What I learned

This was my first full project using TypeScript. It was great to learn how to keep my code strictly typed, the thought of TypeScript speeding up the programmers ability to code was not quite there as I got to grips with interfaces and assigning datatypes all over the place, but it's a start on the right path.

Another part of learning for me is that next time I will make sure I build mobile first, and larger devices second / third. I discovered that with the way I built the app, once it was time to bring in breakpoints for mobile phones, the breakpoints were not small enough, so it would have been easier and cleaner to have started with my generic sizing for mobiles and then using md: lg: and xl: as required. 


### Continued development

I want to build my next project again with the same tools of TypeScipt and Tailwind, to solidify my understading with both. 

This project can also do with some refactoring into different components, as it's currently just one giant app.tsx - which nobody loves!
